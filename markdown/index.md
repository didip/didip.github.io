[<h2>Back to blogging again. This time in Go!</h2>](/posts/1424762251437171629-back-to-blogging.html)

All my friends know that I've been enamored with [Go](https://golang.org/) nowadays. This blog engine (static-site generator) is another perfect excuse to write even more Go.

For your reading pleasure, I'll share some of the blog's interesting parts you may find useful.
